# Question Box
##Welcome to Question Box!

To see our app live on Heroku, go to:
https://sheltered-citadel-50707.herokuapp.com/

Run this to connect server to database
```
$ export DATABASE_URL=postgres:///<NAME OF DATABASE>
```

Feel free to explore the app, but you'll find a main page filled with a current list of all the questions, a profile page, a page to ask a new question, and a logout button all located in the main menu once you've signed up and logged in (see the menu option to do so if not).  Once on the main page, you can click through on any question to see a more detailed page with answers and comments.

Nearly finished features include seeing all your contributions on your profile page, voting on questions and answers, and choosing an accepted answer.

Upcoming planned features include editing or removing questions within certain constraints and tags for tracking keywords on questions.

Thanks for visiting!
